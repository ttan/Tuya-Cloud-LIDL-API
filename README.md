# Tuya Cloud LIDL API
 Device agnostic APIs for Tuya Cloud based devices branded for LIDL

You made it so far, it means you're looking for this. I don't have to write a proper explanation though. You clearly need a Tuya Cloud account where you can link your devices and get the API tokens first.
If you have questions please contact me, it's faster then writing it here.

Thanks to (this person who made the dirty job for authentication)[https://github.com/TuyaAPI/cloud].

Also, it's really dumb code, but it works with all devices. It works!
